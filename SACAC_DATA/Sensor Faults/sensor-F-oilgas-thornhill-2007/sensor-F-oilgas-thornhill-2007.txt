Description: It is known that the there was a faulty steam sensor in the steam flow loop FC1. It was an orifice plate flow meter but there was no weep-hole in the plate which had the effect that condensate collected on the upstream side until it reached a critical level, and the accumulated liquid would then periodically clear itself by siphoning through the orifice. The challenge for the analysis of this unit is to verify that the faulty steam flow loop is the root cause of the disturbance.
